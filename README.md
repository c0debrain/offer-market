# Offer Market
An app that allows buyers and sellers to privately negotiate a price for a listing in an easy, streamlined way with sellers making an offer. 
Buyers set an acceptable price per product ($ amount) (% off retail) and the app does the rest in real time. It declines offers lower than the minimum price set and if the offer is within the acceptable amounts it will approve, let them add it to cart, and then generates a coupon that the buyer can present on product delivery.
