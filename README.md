Offer Market is a multi vendor mini-site derivative of the reactioncommerce meteor app that allows buyers and sellers to privately negotiate the price for a listing in a fast streamlined way with sellers creating offers and buyers making the offer.
The site works by allowing buyers to set an acceptable price per product ($ amount) (% off retail) and the web app can either decline offers lower than the minimum price set or approves if the offer is within the acceptable amounts. It then lets buyers add the accepted offer item to cart, and then generates a coupon that the buyer can present on product delivery.
