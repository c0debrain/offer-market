  Email Validation
  Method for validating email addresses for authenticity.

# Include future library. This is an NPM package, but as it's already a part of
# Meteor's core, we can do an Npm.require without importing it elsewhere first!
Future = Npm.require('fibers/future');

Meteor.methods(
  validateEmailAddress: (address)->
    # Check our email address against our expected pattern.
    check(address,String)
    # Make use of Meteor's HTTP package to call on the Kickbox email validation
    # API (this ensures we're not allowing invalid addresses to signup for our
    # app). Note: we need to wrap this in a future as the HTTP all is made
    # asynchronously and we want to get a response from Kickbox before we continue.

          # we don't use a throw because that would block the Method, preventing
          # our error from reaching the client.
